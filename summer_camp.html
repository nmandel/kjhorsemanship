										<h1>Meet our Horses</h1>
									</header>
									<h2>Colonel</h2>
									<a class="bordered-feature-image"><img src="images/Colonel.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This handsome 21 year old quarter horse has been there, done that, and even has a college education! He is gentle, sweet, and slow with beginners. He does everything he can to make sure that you don’t come off, including stopping if you lose your balance, or not going fast if he doesn’t feel you are balanced enough to handle it. While patient with beginners, he also enjoys riders that allow him to show off his fancier buttons such as leg yields, collection, and canter departures. He has been the favorite of many kids over the years. 
									</p>
									<br>

									<h2>Sedona</h2>
									<a class="bordered-feature-image"><img src="images/Sedona.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This beautiful 26 year old quarter horse pony has been a favorite lesson horse for over half of her life. She is calm, gentle and utterly patient with beginners. She has the smoothest trot of all the horses, and even if you are not communicating clearly what you want, she has been around the block enough times and is willing enough that she will usually figure it out and give it to you anyway. Her favorite things include being doted on by children, eating extra food, and taking naps at every opportunity. 
									</p>
									<br>

									<h2>Annie</h2>
									<a class="bordered-feature-image"><img src="images/Annie.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This tall beautiful Hanoverian mare is 20 years old.  She is sweet and solid. Her bouncy trot and willingness to go forward makes her a favorite for learning to post on. She enjoys being doted on, and having personal space from other horses. Carrots are her favorite snack.
									</p>
									<br>

									<h2>Lavender</h2>
									<a class="bordered-feature-image"><img src="images/Lavender.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This 6 year old Andalusian mare is eye catchingly beautiful with a people oriented personality. She loves to bond and spend time with people most of all, but also enjoys the company of other horses. She is curious and willing. She enjoys having a job and going places with her people.
									</p>
									<br>

									<h2>Luna</h2>
									<a class="bordered-feature-image"><img src="images/Luna.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This 3 year old Arab Andalusian filly cross is full of personality. She is curious about everything and wants to be a part of anything and everything that goes on. She is sweet, with a benign mischievous streak that causes endless entertainment. She knows all kinds of tricks that she loves to share with people. She has been in training her entire life and is extremely well behaved. Her skills include; long lining, laying down on command, rearing on command, drinking out of a bottle, zipping up jackets, picking up hats and whips, dancing (beginnings of the piaffe), liberty work, leading/positioning, and endless amusement. We may not ride her, but she is still a favorite.
