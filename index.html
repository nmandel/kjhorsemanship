											    "Some people come into your life for one reason, and you later find out that fate really had many reasons that seem totally unrelated for bringing that person to your life.  I wanted to take riding lessons for my whole life but had put it off. When I finally decided I’d like to learn to ride horses, I had been quietly searching for over a year for the right person.  Katie came along and I knew that she was the right one. The way she interacted with her own horse, Colonel, showed me that she is not only kind to people, but also to horses. Katie Mandel is the complete horse trainer.  She has the kindness to understand.  She has the intuitiveness to see through your fears and confusion.  She has the perseverance to help you persevere when you think you can’t.  She has all the knowledge needed about horse care, nutrition, training, and stabling.  She has the tact to deal with you on your funky days and to help you deal with other horse people.  And above all she has the sense of humor that comes out at just the right time to allow you to laugh.  When I started with Katie, I was afraid to trot and literally could not make even a seasoned lesson horse go forward.  Now, I have learned so much that I cannot even count it all. She has taught me all the whys behind everything we do on the horses. She has helped me understand myself, my body, my goals, and each horse as an individual.  I still have so much to learn, and Katie is the one to teach me.  She loves children, adults, and people of any age, and everyone loves her back.  I cannot recommend Katie enough.  She has taught me that I can try anything at any age and to listen to my feelings and my body, and the horse’s and work with it all, not against it.  Katie has a gift, and is a special gift to all who know her."

												"I came to Katie with a very nervous and anxious horse.  She was bought from a kill pen out of Oklahoma and transported all the way to California.  I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  Although she was very loving and trusting, she was hard to control. She had no idea how to relax and was all go.  At the age of 15, she didn't even know how to back up. Katie has not only taught my horse how to relax, she has taught her how to deal with her nervousness and anxiousness.  It has been an amazing transformation for the both of us.  Katie also teaches you as the owner how to read your horse and explains why so you are understanding how to work with them.  Katie has created such a strong and trusting bond for the both of us.  My mare is a completely different horse.  We both have confidence that we did not have before.  Because of Katie's patience and gift with horses, Daytona and I both are able to enjoy a nice relaxing ride.  She has a gift of natural horsemanship. I don't know where Daytona and I would be today without Katie."

												"When Katie gives direction she does it with respect and makes sure that I understand what I am asking my horse and why. She
												is patient with me when I am nervous or slow to 'get it' and she doesn’t get mad at me or my horse. This helps my horse and
												me gain confidence and trust to move on to the next step. 
												<br>
												She is horse and people savvy, competent, easygoing, friendly, truly approachable and there are no stupid questions. She will correct you without making you feel inept and will explain what you are telling your horse from his viewpoint. You might think that you are clearly telling him to do something but he keeps doing the 'wrong' thing. Sometimes it turns out that he is doing exactly what you are telling him to do. Once you learn to communicate clearly, your horse is likely to do what you asked and you are on your way."
