										I have been passionate about horses from a very young age. I sat on my first horse at around 2, spent my childhood taking lessons, riding and caring for my horse, and spending every second of free time at the barn all the way up until I took my horse with me to college. I graduated from Feather River College with degrees in <a href="images/AA_EquineStudies_20140523.pdf">Equine Training</a>, <a href="images/Certificate_PackStation_StableOperations_20140523.pdf">Pack Skills</a>, and <a href="images/Certificate_RanchSkills_20140523.pdf">Ranch Skills</a>. By 2014, I had taught summer camp for 5 seasons. In 2018 I began teaching lessons and training horses full time. Every day I work to further my knowledge and skill in training horses and teaching lessons.  I have experience in a wide range of breeds and disciplines.

										<h2>Danielle Landre, Assistent trainer and instructor</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										My first experience with horses was a guided trail ride through the oak covered foothills of California at the age of 8. It ignited a love and passion for horses that has deepened every day since and has single-handedly altered the trajectory of my life. I immediately enrolled in riding lessons and gave up all my extra curricular activities in order to devote my time and attention to riding. As the years went on and my hunger for knowledge grew I participated in as many disciplines and activities as I could: gymkhana, jumping, cow sorting, colt starting, trail riding, etc. and it all contributed to forming the well-rounded rider I am today. In 2018 I moved to Colorado and my life came full circle as I became a Wrangler and later the manager of a dude ranch guiding trail rides through the Rocky Mountains - a true testament to the profound impact that first trail ride had on the rest of my life. Now that I've returned to California, it is a privilege to work and learn alongside my life long friend and outstanding horsewoman, Katie, at KJHorsemanship.
